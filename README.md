# Mydds-c
code designed and developed using rti-dds for
Data Communication using DDS  
Scope  
The purpose or problem or goal of this implementation.
-  to communicate send/receive messages between applications.
- standardize send/receive between applications and systems too.
- isolate applications from the RTI-DDS library 
- minimize code generated by rtiddsgen.  
DDS: Data-Distribution Service (DDS) is a virtual Global Data Space where applications can share information by  reading and writing data.

implemented above with RTI-DD library, Linux/C in following .c and .h Makefiles. Created common ddsapi library.  
IPRC_COMM_LINK.idl   
iprclink__interface.h  
iprclink__types.h  
iprclink_api.c  

iprclink_api_rd_test.c  
iprclink_api_wr_test.c  

Makefile  

===command to build=====  
$make -f Makefile gendds
--this is to generate the DDS files. 

$make -f Makefile
--this will biuld libiprc in TNG_HOME/lib

$make -f Makefile tests
--this will biuld publisher and subscriber to test API.
